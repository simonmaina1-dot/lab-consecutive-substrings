Solution Description:
---------------------
The function consecutiveSubstrings generates all consecutive substrings of a string.
It uses nested loops: the outer loop sets the starting index, and the inner loop sets the ending index for the substring.
Each substring is extracted using slice() and added to the result array.
This approach preserves the order of appearance and handles strings of any length, including empty strings.

Time Complexity:
----------------
- Outer loop: O(n)
- Inner loop: O(n-i)
- Total: O(n^2)
Space Complexity:
- O(n^2) to store all substrings
